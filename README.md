## Reflection

1. While JMeter is useful for evaluating overall system performance under load conditions, IntelliJ Profiler is instrumental in pinpointing specific areas of code that require optimization to improve application performance. Combining both approaches provides a comprehensive strategy for optimizing application performance effectively.
2. The profiling process helps in identifying and understanding the weak points in an application by providing detailed insights into its runtime behavior. By analyzing metrics such as CPU usage, memory allocation, method execution times, and thread activity, developers can pinpoint areas of the codebase that are contributing to performance bottlenecks. Profiling reveals hotspots, inefficient algorithms, memory leaks, excessive resource usage, and concurrency issues, allowing developers to prioritize optimization efforts effectively. Understanding these weak points enables developers to make targeted improvements to the application code, resulting in enhanced performance, scalability, and reliability.
